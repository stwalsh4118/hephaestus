[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Add repository ignore rules for local or generated development artifacts so they do not appear as untracked changes or get committed accidentally.

## Requirements

1. Ignore backend local build/runtime artifacts generated during development runs.
2. Ignore frontend local package-store cache generated in this environment.
3. Keep ignore scope narrow to artifacts that should never be committed.
4. Verify ignored paths no longer appear in `git status`.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add a root `.gitignore` file for cross-project ignore rules.
2. Add targeted entries for backend artifacts and frontend cache.
3. Re-run `git status --short` to confirm artifacts are ignored.

## Test Plan

- Run `git status --short`.
- Confirm `backend/server`, `backend/tmp/`, and `frontend/.pnpm-store/` are not listed as untracked.
- Confirm only intentional tracked-file changes remain visible.

## Verification

- Added root `.gitignore` entries for:
  - `/backend/server`
  - `/backend/tmp/`
  - `/frontend/.pnpm-store/`
- `git status --short` no longer shows those local artifact paths as untracked.
- Ignore rules are narrowly scoped to generated/local-only artifacts.
- Internal AI review verdict: `pass`.
