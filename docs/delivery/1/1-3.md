# [1-3] Docker Compose Dev Environment

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a Docker Compose configuration that runs the frontend dev server and Go backend in containers with a shared network, enabling the full dev environment to start with a single command.

## Requirements

1. `docker-compose.yml` (or `compose.yaml`) at the project root
2. Frontend service: runs Next.js dev server with hot reload, maps port 3000
3. Backend service: runs Go server, maps port 8080
4. Shared Docker network for inter-service communication
5. Volume mounts for live code reloading (source directories mounted into containers)
6. `docker compose up` starts all services successfully

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `Dockerfile` for backend dev (Go image, hot reload via `air` or simple rebuild)
2. Create `Dockerfile` for frontend dev (Node image, pnpm install, dev server)
3. Create `docker-compose.yml` with:
   - `frontend` service: Node image, volume mount `./frontend`, port `3000:3000`
   - `backend` service: Go image, volume mount `./backend`, port `8080:8080`
   - Shared network `hephaestus-net`
4. Add `.dockerignore` files to avoid copying `node_modules`, build artifacts
5. Verify `docker compose up` brings up both services and they respond on their ports

## Test Plan

- `docker compose build` completes without errors
- `docker compose up` starts both services
- Frontend accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend health check accessible at `http://localhost:8080/health`
- Both services on the same Docker network
