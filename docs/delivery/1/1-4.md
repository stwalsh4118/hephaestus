# [1-4] Linting & Formatting Configuration

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Configure ESLint and Prettier for the frontend (TypeScript/React) and golangci-lint for the backend (Go), establishing code quality standards from the start.

## Requirements

1. ESLint configured for the frontend with Next.js and TypeScript rules
2. Prettier configured for the frontend with consistent formatting rules
3. ESLint and Prettier integrated (no conflicting rules)
4. `golangci-lint` configuration file in `backend/` with sensible defaults
5. Lint commands runnable: `pnpm lint` (frontend), `golangci-lint run` (backend)
6. All existing code passes linting without errors

## Implementation Plan

1. Frontend: verify ESLint config from `create-next-app` scaffolding, extend if needed
2. Frontend: add Prettier with config file (`.prettierrc`), install `eslint-config-prettier`
3. Frontend: add `lint` and `format` scripts to `package.json`
4. Backend: create `.golangci.yml` with standard linters (govet, errcheck, staticcheck, gosimple, unused)
5. Verify all existing code passes both linters

## Test Plan

- `pnpm lint` in `frontend/` passes with no errors
- `pnpm format --check` in `frontend/` reports no formatting issues (or auto-fixes)
- `golangci-lint run ./...` in `backend/` passes with no errors

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._
