## Requirements

1. Next.js app created in `frontend/` with TypeScript enabled
2. pnpm used as the package manager (no npm or yarn lockfiles)
3. `pnpm install` installs dependencies without errors
4. `pnpm dev` starts the Next.js dev server
5. A basic landing page renders at `/` with the project name
6. App Router (Next.js 14+ convention) used

## Implementation Plan

1. Run `pnpm create next-app frontend` with TypeScript, ESLint, App Router options
2. Verify `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists (not `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`)
3. Ensure `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` has a minimal landing page with "Hephaestus" title
4. Verify `pnpm dev` starts without errors

## Test Plan

- `pnpm install` completes without errors
- `pnpm build` compiles successfully
- Dev server starts and the landing page renders at `http://localhost:3000`

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._
