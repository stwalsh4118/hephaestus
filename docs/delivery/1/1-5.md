# [1-5] Makefile for Dev Commands

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a root-level Makefile providing common development commands that wrap frontend, backend, and Docker operations into simple targets.

## Requirements

1. Makefile at the project root
2. Targets for: `dev` (start Docker Compose), `build` (build frontend + backend), `lint` (run all linters), `test` (run all tests), `down` (stop Docker Compose), `clean` (remove build artifacts)
3. Each target clearly documented with comments or a `help` target
4. Targets work correctly from the project root

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `Makefile` at project root
2. Define targets:
   - `help` — list available targets with descriptions (default target)
   - `dev` — `docker compose up --build`
   - `dev-down` / `down` — `docker compose down`
   - `build` — build frontend (`pnpm build`) and backend (`go build`)
   - `lint` — run frontend lint + backend lint
   - `test` — run frontend tests + backend tests
   - `clean` — remove build artifacts, node_modules caches, Go build cache
3. Use `.PHONY` declarations for all targets

## Test Plan

- `make help` displays available targets
- `make lint` runs both frontend and backend linters successfully
- `make build` builds both frontend and backend without errors

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._
