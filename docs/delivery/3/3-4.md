# [3-4] Configuration Side Panel

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a configuration side panel that slides in from the right when a canvas node is selected. The panel displays the node's service type, name, and acts as a container for service-specific config forms (tasks 3-5 and 3-6). Clicking the canvas background or a close button dismisses the panel.

## Requirements

1. Panel slides in from the right edge when a node is selected
2. Panel shows: service type icon/colour header, node label (editable), service type badge
3. Panel has a close button that deselects the node
4. Clicking the canvas pane deselects the node and closes the panel
5. Panel width ~320px, does not overlay the canvas (pushes or overlays with proper z-index)
6. Panel body is a slot/container for service-specific form content (rendered in tasks 3-5/3-6)
7. Smooth open/close transition (CSS transition or Tailwind animate)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `frontend/src/components/config/ConfigPanel.tsx`:
   - Reads `selectedNodeId` and `useSelectedNode()` from store
   - Conditionally renders when a node is selected
   - Header: colour bar + icon + editable node label
   - Body: placeholder text "Configuration options will appear here" (replaced by tasks 3-5/3-6)
   - Close button calls `selectNode(null)`
2. Update `frontend/src/components/canvas/DiagramWorkspace.tsx`:
   - Add `ConfigPanel` to the layout (right side of canvas)
3. Update `frontend/src/components/canvas/DiagramCanvas.tsx`:
   - Add `onPaneClick` handler to call `selectNode(null)`
   - Ensure `onNodeClick` calls `selectNode(nodeId)`
4. Add CSS transition for slide-in/out animation

## Test Plan

- Clicking a node opens the config panel with correct service type and label
- Clicking the close button closes the panel
- Clicking the canvas background closes the panel
- Panel displays correct colour and icon for the selected node's service type
- Panel transition is smooth (visual verification)
