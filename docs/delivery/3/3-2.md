# [3-2] Custom React Flow Node Components

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create visually distinct custom React Flow node components for each of the 5 service types. Each node displays its service icon, label, and a colour-coded header/border. Register the custom node types with the React Flow `nodeTypes` prop so they render instead of default nodes.

## Requirements

1. Create a `ServiceNode` component (or per-type components) that renders:
   - Colour-coded header bar with service icon abbreviation
   - Service label (user-editable name or default)
   - Connection handles (source and target)
   - Visual distinction at a glance (different background colour per type)
2. Register custom node types in `DiagramCanvas.tsx` via the `nodeTypes` prop
3. Update the `addNode` flow to set the correct React Flow `type` field matching the registered custom node type
4. Nodes must support React Flow's built-in drag, selection, and resize behaviours

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `frontend/src/components/canvas/nodes/ServiceNode.tsx` — a shared custom node component that reads `data.type` to apply service-specific styling (colour, icon from constants)
2. Create `frontend/src/components/canvas/nodes/index.ts` — exports `nodeTypes` map for React Flow registration
3. Update `DiagramCanvas.tsx`:
   - Import and pass `nodeTypes` to `<ReactFlow>`
   - Update `onDrop` handler to set `type: "service-node"` (or per-type key) on created nodes
4. Style nodes using Tailwind classes with inline colour overrides from `SERVICE_COLORS`

## Test Plan

- TypeScript compilation passes
- Each of the 5 service types renders with correct colour and icon when dropped onto canvas
- Nodes remain draggable and selectable
- Connection handles are visible and functional
- Visual inspection via Playwright snapshot
