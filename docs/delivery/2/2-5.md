# [2-5] Build Component Palette Sidebar

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a sidebar panel that displays a list of draggable component items. These are generic placeholders (not service-specific types — those come in PBI-3). Users initiate a drag from this sidebar to add components to the canvas.

## Requirements

1. Create a `ComponentPalette` sidebar component
2. Sidebar positioned on the left side of the viewport, adjacent to the canvas
3. Display generic palette items using the `PALETTE_ITEMS` constant from task 2-2
4. Each palette item must be draggable using HTML5 Drag API (`draggable` attribute, `onDragStart` handler)
5. On drag start, set transfer data identifying the dragged item type (using `dataTransfer.setData`)
6. Each item must show a label and visual indicator
7. Sidebar must be styled consistently with the application theme (Tailwind CSS)
8. Sidebar must not overlap or obscure the canvas

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `frontend/src/components/palette/ComponentPalette.tsx`
2. Render palette items from `PALETTE_ITEMS` constant
3. Implement `onDragStart` handler that sets `dataTransfer` with the item type
4. Style sidebar using Tailwind: fixed width, left-positioned, scrollable if needed
5. Update main page layout to place palette alongside canvas

**Dependencies**: Task 2-2 (types and constants for palette items)

## Test Plan

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Sidebar renders with all palette items visible
- Each item is visually identifiable with label
- Drag initiates on mousedown+move (browser DnD cursor appears)
- Sidebar does not overlap canvas content
- Browser verification via Playwright: navigate to `/`, confirm sidebar renders with draggable items

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._
