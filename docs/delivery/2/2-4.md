# [2-4] Build Base React Flow Canvas Component

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the core React Flow canvas component that occupies the main viewport area. This component renders the interactive canvas with background grid, minimap, zoom/pan controls, and wires into the Zustand store for state management. Replace the placeholder landing page with the canvas as the main application view.

## Requirements

1. Create a `DiagramCanvas` component wrapping `<ReactFlow>` from `@xyflow/react`
2. Canvas must fill the main viewport area (full height minus any chrome)
3. Include `<Background>` component with dot or grid pattern for alignment reference
4. Include `<MiniMap>` component in a corner for orientation on large diagrams
5. Include `<Controls>` component for zoom-in, zoom-out, and fit-to-view buttons
6. Canvas must support zoom via scroll wheel and pan via background drag (React Flow defaults)
7. Connect to Zustand store: read nodes/edges, wire `onNodesChange`/`onEdgesChange` handlers
8. Nodes must be repositionable by dragging
9. Selected nodes must show visual highlight (React Flow default behavior)
10. Import React Flow CSS stylesheet
11. Update the main page (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`) to render the canvas as the primary view
12. Wrap the app with `<ReactFlowProvider>` as needed

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `frontend/src/components/canvas/DiagramCanvas.tsx`
2. Import and render `<ReactFlow>` with `<Background>`, `<MiniMap>`, `<Controls>`
3. Connect to canvas store via Zustand selectors for nodes, edges, and change handlers
4. Apply React Flow's required CSS import
5. Create a layout wrapper component if needed for full-viewport sizing
6. Update `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to render the `DiagramCanvas` component
7. Ensure `ReactFlowProvider` wraps the component tree

**Dependencies**: Task 2-2 (types), Task 2-3 (store)

## Test Plan

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Canvas renders in the browser without console errors
- Background grid/dots are visible
- MiniMap is visible in a corner
- Controls (zoom in/out/fit) are visible and functional
- Scroll wheel zooms the canvas
- Click-drag on background pans the canvas
- Browser verification via Playwright: navigate to `/`, confirm canvas renders with background and controls
