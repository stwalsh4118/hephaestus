# [2-1] Install React Flow and Zustand Dependencies

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Install the external packages required for PBI-2: `@xyflow/react` (React Flow v12+) for the interactive canvas and `zustand` for lightweight state management. Create date-stamped research guides for each package documenting verified API usage patterns relevant to this project.

## Requirements

1. Install `@xyflow/react` as a production dependency
2. Install `zustand` as a production dependency
3. Create research guide `docs/delivery/2/2-1-xyflow-react-guide.md` with date-stamped, verified API usage examples for React Flow (nodes, edges, hooks, event handlers, drag-and-drop patterns)
4. Create research guide `docs/delivery/2/2-1-zustand-guide.md` with date-stamped, verified API usage examples for Zustand (store creation, selectors, middleware, React integration)
5. Verify both packages install without peer dependency conflicts
6. Confirm TypeScript types are included or install `@types/*` if needed

## Implementation Plan

1. Research `@xyflow/react` docs via web; document API patterns in guide file
2. Research `zustand` docs via web; document API patterns in guide file
3. Run `pnpm add @xyflow/react zustand` in the `frontend/` directory
4. Verify `pnpm install` completes cleanly with no warnings
5. Verify TypeScript recognizes the packages (no type errors on basic imports)

**External Packages**: This task requires research and a guide document for: @xyflow/react, zustand

## Test Plan

- `pnpm install` completes without errors or peer dependency warnings
- TypeScript compilation passes (`pnpm run build` or `tsc --noEmit`)
- Both packages can be imported in a test file without type errors

## Verification

- Ran `pnpm add @xyflow/react zustand` in `frontend/`; both packages installed successfully (`@xyflow/react@12.10.0`, `zustand@5.0.11`).
- Ran `pnpm install` in `frontend/`; lockfile was up to date and install completed without peer dependency warnings.
- Ran `pnpm test` (`tsc --noEmit`) in `frontend/`; TypeScript check passed.
- Created package research guides with date-stamped API examples:
  - `docs/delivery/2/2-1-xyflow-react-guide.md`
  - `docs/delivery/2/2-1-zustand-guide.md`
- Internal AI review verdict: `pass`.
