# [2-2] Define Canvas Types and Constants

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Define the TypeScript interfaces, types, and named constants that will be shared across all canvas-related components and the Zustand store. This establishes the data contracts before implementation begins.

## Requirements

1. Define a `PaletteItem` interface representing a draggable item in the sidebar (id, label, icon/type identifier)
2. Define a `CanvasNodeData` interface extending React Flow's node data for custom node rendering (label, type, description)
3. Define a `NodeType` enum or union type for the generic placeholder component types available in the palette
4. Define named constants: default viewport position/zoom, grid spacing, min/max zoom levels, palette item definitions
5. All types must be exported from a central location (`@/types/canvas.ts` or similar)
6. All constants must be exported from a central location (`@/constants/canvas.ts` or similar)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `frontend/src/types/canvas.ts` with all interface/type definitions
2. Create `frontend/src/constants/canvas.ts` with all named constants
3. Ensure types align with React Flow's `Node<T>` and `Edge` generic types from `@xyflow/react`
4. Export everything cleanly for consumption by store and components

**Dependencies**: Task 2-1 (packages must be installed for React Flow type imports)

## Test Plan

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors (`tsc --noEmit`)
- All types and constants are importable from their defined paths

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._
