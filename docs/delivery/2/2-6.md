# [2-6] Integrate Drag-and-Drop from Palette to Canvas

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Wire the drag-and-drop flow end-to-end: when a user drags an item from the palette sidebar and drops it onto the React Flow canvas, a new node is created at the drop position. This is the core interaction that ties the palette and canvas together.

## Requirements

1. Implement `onDragOver` handler on the React Flow canvas to allow drops (`event.preventDefault()` + set `dropEffect`)
2. Implement `onDrop` handler on the React Flow canvas that:
   - Reads the item type from `dataTransfer`
   - Converts the drop screen coordinates to React Flow canvas coordinates using `screenToFlowPosition`
   - Calls the store's `addNode` action with the correct position and node data
3. Newly created nodes must appear at the exact drop position
4. Newly created nodes must be immediately draggable/repositionable
5. Multiple nodes can be dropped sequentially without issues
6. Each dropped node gets a unique ID

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `onDragOver` and `onDrop` props to the `<ReactFlow>` component in `DiagramCanvas`
2. In `onDrop`, extract item type from `dataTransfer.getData()`
3. Use React Flow's `useReactFlow` hook to access `screenToFlowPosition` for coordinate conversion
4. Call `addNode` from the canvas store with the computed position and item data
5. Generate unique node IDs (e.g., using a counter or `crypto.randomUUID()`)
6. Test the full flow: drag from palette → drop on canvas → node appears

**Dependencies**: Task 2-3 (store with `addNode`), Task 2-4 (canvas component), Task 2-5 (palette with drag)

## Test Plan

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Dragging a palette item over the canvas shows a drop-allowed cursor
- Dropping a palette item on the canvas creates a new node at the drop location
- The new node is visible and labeled correctly
- The new node can be repositioned by dragging
- Dropping multiple items creates multiple distinct nodes
- Canvas state (node count, positions) persists across re-renders
- Browser verification via Playwright: drag from palette → drop on canvas → verify node appears → drag node to new position
