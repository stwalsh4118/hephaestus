## Description

Update `docs/api-specs/docker/docker-api.md` with all new types, interfaces, and constants introduced by PBI 7: template types, port allocator, dependency resolver, and translator.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |

## Requirements

1. Document the `ContainerTemplate` interface
2. Document the `TemplateRegistry` type and `NewRegistry()` constructor
3. Document image and port constants for all 5 service types
4. Document the `PortAllocator` type and its methods
5. Document the `ResolveDependencies` function signature
6. Document the `Translator` type and `Translate` method
7. Follow the existing format and style of `docker-api.md`

## Implementation Plan

- Add a new "## Service-to-Container Mapping" section to `docs/api-specs/docker/docker-api.md`
- Subsections for: Templates, Port Allocator, Dependency Resolver, Translator
- Include Go type signatures and constant tables
- Reference the package path `backend/internal/docker/templates`

## Test Plan

- Verify the markdown renders correctly (no broken formatting)
- Verify all types/functions documented match the actual implementation from tasks 7-1 through 7-5

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._
