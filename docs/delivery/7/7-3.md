# [7-3] Port Allocator

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement a port allocator that assigns unique host ports to containers, avoiding conflicts. The allocator tracks used ports within a deployment session and assigns from a configurable range.

## Requirements

1. Allocate unique host ports from a defined range (e.g., 10000–19999)
2. Track allocated ports to prevent conflicts within a deployment
3. Support allocating multiple ports for a single service (e.g., RabbitMQ needs 2 ports)
4. Provide a `Reset()` method to clear allocations for a new deployment
5. Return an error if the port range is exhausted
6. Thread-safe for concurrent use

## Implementation Plan

- Create `backend/internal/docker/templates/port_allocator.go`
- `PortAllocator` struct with:
  - `minPort`, `maxPort` range bounds
  - `usedPorts` set (map[string]bool)
  - `nextPort` cursor for sequential allocation
  - `sync.Mutex` for thread safety
- `NewPortAllocator(minPort, maxPort int) *PortAllocator`
- `Allocate() (string, error)` — returns next available port as string
- `AllocateN(n int) ([]string, error)` — allocates N consecutive-available ports
- `Reset()` — clears all allocations

## Test Plan

- Unit test sequential allocation returns unique ports
- Unit test `AllocateN` returns correct number of ports, all unique
- Unit test `Reset` allows reuse of previously allocated ports
- Unit test exhaustion returns an error
- Unit test thread safety with concurrent allocations
