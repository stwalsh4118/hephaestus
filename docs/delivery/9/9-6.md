# [9-6] Live Topology Updates

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Enable live topology updates so that adding or removing nodes from a deployed diagram applies changes incrementally without full teardown. The frontend detects diagram changes while deployed and sends updated topology to the backend, which diffs and applies only the changes.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |

## Requirements

1. **Backend — Incremental Deploy Endpoint**:
   - `PUT /api/deploy` — accepts updated diagram JSON
   - Calls `DeploymentManager.ComputeDiff` then `ApplyDiff`
   - Returns `200 OK` with updated status
   - Returns `409 Conflict` if not currently deployed
2. **Frontend — Change Detection**:
   - When deployed and the user adds a node → auto-trigger or provide a "Re-deploy" / "Update" button
   - When deployed and the user removes a node → same trigger
   - Design choice: explicit "Update Deploy" button (appears when diagram differs from deployed state) rather than auto-deploy, to give user control
3. **Frontend — Update Deploy Button**:
   - Appears in toolbar only when deployed AND diagram has changed since last deploy
   - Calls `PUT /api/deploy` with current diagram
   - Track "last deployed diagram" snapshot in deploy store for comparison
4. **Diff Detection Logic** (frontend):
   - Compare current node IDs vs last-deployed node IDs
   - Simple set comparison — new IDs = added, missing IDs = removed
5. Update API spec with the PUT endpoint

## Implementation Plan

- Add `PUT /api/deploy` handler in `backend/internal/handler/deploy.go`
- Register route in `main.go`
- Add `lastDeployedDiagram` to deploy store
- Add `hasChanges` derived state (compare current vs last deployed)
- Add "Update Deploy" button in toolbar (visible only when `hasChanges && deployStatus === 'deployed'`)
- Update `docs/api-specs/backend/backend-api.md`

## Test Plan

- **Backend unit tests**:
  - `PUT /api/deploy` with added node → only new container created
  - `PUT /api/deploy` with removed node → only that container removed
  - `PUT /api/deploy` when not deployed → 409
- **Frontend unit tests**:
  - `hasChanges` returns true when node added after deploy
  - `hasChanges` returns false when diagram matches last deployed
- **Integration** (covered by E2E task):
  - Deploy → add node → update → verify only new container started
